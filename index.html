        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Born and raise in Nigeria I've been living in the US for ten years now I went to school for Nursing after two years I decided to change majors to Business Administration. I have had many jobs from being a Deli Clerk to pushing carts at Costco to being a cashier at a local grocery store to being a Nurse, salesman and now as an Uber driver and then as a Web Developer in the coming months. I have lived in New York, Alabama, Atlanta and now the beautiful city of San Francisco which is the best so far I tell my friends that if I had known about San Francisco ten years ago this would have been my first stop, if you have never been I strongly recommend you do so you will not regret in it.
        <p>I am getting into the tech scene because I've always had passion for technology and curious about how things work I am hoping to bring all of my life experiences and creativity to life through technology and hopefully create something that will to benefit or help mankind in some way shape or form.</p>
